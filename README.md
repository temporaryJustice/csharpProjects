# CsharpProjects
Projects I do on my free time to become better at c#. These are not some finalized programs ready for prod or anything.

- Small "ATM" app : could add the save of added accounts to a file/db.
- Movie Watcher app: Pissed that you always need to search for movies? This is an auto searcher for you. Lolz
